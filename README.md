# My Recipe Website
This website features a recipe that can be made with accessible ingredients made by my mother.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I thought to myself when I first started learning HTML & CSS, "What the heck kind of project do I make with this, there are so many options! Suddenly, a light went off in my brain. "Wait, my mom told me about a recipe which I happened to write in my notes app, why don't I use that same recipe and publish it online to showcase my knowledge of these two markup languages?" 
And that I did. Brainstorming ideas on the HMTL aspect of the website came easy because I had already looked at some sample recipe websites prior to starting, and knew exactly what information I wanted to include.
The most time-consuming was the CSS - there were so many styling options I could do for my website. For a couple weeks, I experimented with colors, text-alignment, etc and learned about classes & ids and how the specificity of them making them very useful for targetting certain elements. Thankfully, the css began flowing from here.

## Optimizations
I learned various things nearing the end of my project such as website responsiveness on the smallest of resolutions. I implemented this concept into my project. This gave me a huge confidence boost knowing that no matter what device someone was using, they're able to read the same information that one with a high-resolution device would.

## Lessons Learned:

I began my web development journey by going online and searching coding bootcamps for different web-design languages, because although my only knowledge at the time consisted of back-end languages - I wanted to explore front-end as well. 
This is how I discovered streamer Leon Noel - the man himself who made an entire cohort '100Devs' for aspiring web developers. 
This cohort consisted of free and useful content that touched on more than just programming, networking being a major topic. I figured if i was going to start networking, i might as well join their server. 
I joined the discord community with thousands of people - some who have been doing this cohort for a long time, while others hadn't started learning too long ago. 
These amazing, kindhearted people were always happy to help me with any ongoing issues and concerns I had - coding or not coding related. They showed me that it's good to ask for help, and they were ecstatic to offer it. Some quickly turned into good friends who get dearer to my heart as more conversation and laughter is shared.
Anyway, let's get to the point. The biggest lesson I got from this project by far is how important it is to have a supportive community, and people who are patient with you. Another point, being a person who makes it easy for others to be of help to you is also crucial.
