# My Recipe Website
This website features a recipe made originally by my mother.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

I thought to myself when I first started learning HTML & CSS, "What the heck kind of project do I make with this, there are so many options! Suddenly, a light went off in my brain. "Wait, my mom told me about a recipe which I happened to write in my notes app, why don't I use that same recipe and publish it online to showcase my knowledge of these two markup languages?" 
And that I did. Brainstorming ideas on the HMTL aspect of the website came easy because I had already looked at some sample recipe websites prior to starting, and knew exactly what information I wanted to include.
The most time-consuming was the CSS - there were so many styling options I could do for my website. For a couple weeks, I experimented with colors, text-alignment, etc and learned about classes & ids and how the specificity of them making them very useful for targetting certain elements. Thankfully, the css began flowing from here.

## Optimizations
I learned various things nearing the end of my project such as website responsiveness for the smallest of resolutions. I implemented this concept into my project. This gave me a huge confidence boost knowing that no matter what device someone was using, they're able to read the valuable information just as one using a high-resolution device would.

## Lessons Learned:

I began my web development journey by going online and searching coding bootcamps for different web-design languages, because although my only knowledge at the time consisted of back-end languages - I wanted to explore front-end as well. 
This is how I discovered streamer Leon Noel - the man himself who created an entire cohort course community for aspiring web developers called '100Devs'.
This cohort consists of free and useful content that touches on more than just programming - networking being an explicit topic. I figured if i was going to start networking, i might as well join the server and see what these other web devs are up to. 

I joined their discord community with thousands of people - some who have been doing this cohort for a long time, while others hadn't started learning too long ago. 
These amazing, kindhearted people still to this day go out of their way to help me with any concerns that I encounter - coding or not coding related. They taught me that it's good to ask for help, and they have always been ecstatic to offer it. Some quickly became good friends who get dearer to me as each day goes by.
Anyway, let's get to the point. The biggest lesson I got from this project by far is how important it is to have a supportive community. Something that's been pointed out by multiple people is that I am a very curious person who always brings the energy and willingness to learn. Being a person who makes it simple for others to be of help to you is crucial. I find that these two traits have been the biggest aid in helping me network and naturally draw me to the right people.
